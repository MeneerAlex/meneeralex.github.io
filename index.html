            <h1>Fun Facts about the Miata</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Guinness World Record:</strong> The Mazda MX-5 Miata is the best-selling two-seater sports
                    car of all time, with over one million units sold worldwide.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight and Design:</strong> The first-generation Miata (NA) weighs just over 2,100 pounds,
                    which is part of the reason for its nimble handling and quick acceleration.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspired by British Roadsters:</strong> The Miata was inspired by classic British roadsters
                    like the Lotus Elan and MGB, but with the added benefit of Japanese reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Pop-Up Headlights Love:</strong> The first-generation Miata (NA) is famous for its iconic
                    pop-up headlights, which have earned it a special place in car culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Affordable Performance:</strong> The Miata has long been known as the most affordable way to
                    get behind the wheel of a true rear-wheel-drive sports car.</li>
