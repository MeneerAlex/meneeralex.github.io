                    <h1>Why are Miatas so populair?</h1>
                    <p>The Miata is popular because it’s fun to drive, affordable, and reliable. Its lightweight body
                        and rear-wheel drive make it very enjoyable to drive, and it doesn’t cost much compared to other
                        sports cars. Even as prices go up, it still offers great value for money.</p>
                    <p>Another reason is that you can easily customize the Miata. There are many parts available, so
                        owners can improve its performance or change its style. The simple, classic design also attracts
                        people who love old-style roadsters.</p>
                    <p>In short, the Miata is popular because it offers everything drivers want: fun, affordability, and
                        endless possibilities.</p>
